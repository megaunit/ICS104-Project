This project is a terminal-based data management system for patients in a hospital, implemented in Python from scratch. This project served as our project requirement for the ICS104 course in KFUPM.

Note: 
This project was designed to save patient's data in a JSON file. However, my instructor directed to not utilize any libraries (including JSON library), and code everything from scratch. This is neither optimal nor practical, but we had to comply. To view the JSON based version, revert to the "clarifying main file" commit.
